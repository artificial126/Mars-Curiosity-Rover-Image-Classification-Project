# Mars-Curiosity-Rover-Image-Classification-Project
Image Classification on Mars with 24 different classes

## Overview 

This is Image Classification project about Mars curiosity rover. Contains 6691 images collected 2012 to 2015.

## Business Problem

Our aim is in this project is to image classification about Mars. Images collected by Curiosity Rover which launched Nov. 26, 2011 and landed on Mars at Aug. 5, 2012.
Curiosity set out to answer the question: Did Mars ever have the right environmental conditions to support small life forms called microbes? We are going to classify images collected by curiosity rover to help future projects. Our aim to make machine learning model and deploy at the future rovers to make future rover more effective decisions with artificial intelligence depend on mission.
